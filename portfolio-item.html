                <h2>Reassemble.Education</h2><br>
            At present time education system of India is at verge of destruction of creativity in students , they focus only on marks and their syllabus is not promoting research at all. 
            Education system of india do let student decide what exactly a student want to learn , it only promotes two streams ie science and mathematics.</p>

                <h2>World.Without.Disability</h2><br>
            The technical divide between the urban and the rural realms is cincerning. yes, proliferation of data , declining prices of mobile phones and avaibility of internet have made the world better.But there is still an ocean wide difference between the standard of living witnessed in the cities and the vilages . We aim to bridge this technological chasm.
            Biometric prostheses use a combination of sophisticated technologies. Boisensoors, Which receive signals from a user's nervous order muscle system , detect a person's intention to move in a certain way . Mechanical sensors pick up information about the prosthesis' current position.</p>

                <h2>Fight.Against.Cancer</h2><br>
           The area of computed tomography (CT) scan has rapidly emerged as an important tool in medical imaging to supplement X-rays and medical ultrasonography. It has more recently been used for preventive medicine or screening for various diseases like cancer. It is particularly relevant that normal two-dimensional X-rays are not capable to capture the defects. Therefore, a variety of techniques are used, depending on the suspected abnormality. Thus, tomography has to be further explored in order to improve the cancer detection. The major challenge in this direction is to register time-dependent response of any diffraction pattern on atomic scale as observed during X-ray imaging. This is the key to predict the defect which cannot be usually captured from conventional medical imaging tools. Therefore, in this project we propose to implement a system on Field Programmable Gated Array (FPGA) that is capable to detect intensity changes in X-rays due to diffraction or reflections on nano-resolution scale. The main objective of this project is to increase the research and innovation capacity of the collaborating institutions in the field of computational modeling and FPGA based hardware prototyping to register diffraction patterns in X-ray imaging. For this purpose,the project will establish sustainable collaboration platform, in the form of a network of two scientific groups working in the specific domain of hardware modeling and simulations dedicated for studies of registration of diffraction patterns in X-ray imaging.</p>
